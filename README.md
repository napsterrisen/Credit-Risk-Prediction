# Credit-Risk-Prediction
Project Overview Credit default risk is the risk that a lender takes the chance that a borrower fails to make required payments of the loan.  In this project, I utilized different learning algorithms including Logistic regression, decision tree to find the best algorithms, and on top of that, I also implemented RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to fine tune the hyperparamters and further improve the model.  The final model has a 0.839 accuracy score and 0.89 AUROC score.
